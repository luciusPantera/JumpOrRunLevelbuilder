# JumpOrRunLevelbuilder
A Programm to design custom Levels for my small jump and run Game JumpOrRun.
To export a level you build press the green button and the bottom left. It will exprot to a File called "levelX.leveldata" in the Levels Folder. 
Any existing Files with the same Name will be overwritten. 
To import the Level into your Game, copy it to your Levels Folder and achange its Number to the Levelnumber you want it to be.

Feel free to post your Levels in the JumpOrRun discussion.
